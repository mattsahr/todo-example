```

## Pre-requisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)

The app installs correctly on node version `18.16.1`
It might work with older/newer versions of node.

You can use nvm to manage various versions.

[Installing nvm on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows#install-nvm-windows-nodejs-and-npm)


If you plan to use NVM, you will get better results if you first **REMOVE** all versions of node.  Then install NVM, and then let NVM install specific versions that you want.

```
nvm list
nvm install 18.16.1
nvm use 18.16.1
```

## Installing the app

CD into the directory where you installed the todo app.  And then run:

```bash
npm install

And then, to run the project:

```bash
npm run dev
```
